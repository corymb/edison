[01:07:46] <Samian> I appreciate it
[01:08:01] <ouemt> I don't understand enough about how the import process works, so take this with a grain of salt, but I think it's caching a copy of the imported file once it imports. When you try the new name, it doesn't reread the file, it just checks the cached copy and can't find it

[03:36:05] <cagomez> I have `S = 'abcd'`. if I call `sorted(S, key=lambda char: fn(char)`, the fn is being called on every character, right? and then the resulting values are used to actually sort the string?
[03:37:26] <cagomez> I'm a little confused because the examples I've seen use the `key` param when sorting a *list* of elements, and a fn is called for every item of the list (see https://developers.google.com/edu/python/sorting#custom-sorting-with-key )
[03:38:16] <cagomez> where as in the former, I think a fn is being called for every char in the string. would it be fair to say that the String is coerced into a List of elements ?
