[00:03:14] <licnep> anyone here has some experience with cython? My problem is im getting an error but the stack trace only tells me the line of the generated .c file. I would like instead to know the lines of the original .pyx file in the stacktrace. Let me know if you know how to do this (or if you have any suggestion debugging cython code)

[00:52:45] <Indentist> SnoopJeDi, the reason I am asking is that it replaces several lines of "while" when it is used with "for", without having to define what "letter" is: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1031105

[00:55:00] <nedbat__> bjpenn: it may have worked. The pip authors never said it would work. Do you understand the difference?
[00:55:14] <SnoopJeDi> Indentist, the for loop defines it. You should read the tutorial.

[00:55:58] <bjpenn> nedbat__: yeah i see
[00:56:05] <bjpenn> nedbat__: hm how should i refactor this? any ideas?
[00:56:06] <SnoopJeDi> but the tl;dr is for loops in Python work like `for <name> in <iterable>:` where the loop will step over the iterable and assign each object inside it to the given name for that iteration.
[00:56:11] <ace510> understanding for loops is pretty vital, they can be incredibly powerful

[00:57:18] <SnoopJeDi> Indentist, Python's for loops are designed to avoid the boilerplate necessary when writing loops like that `while`. Iterating over some container is _so common_ that it has its own pattern.

[05:20:39] <randomA> i think i am over-complicating my question. I don't know python well. I'm just wondering if I have an object A:  self.a, self.b  and then an object B(A) that calls super().__init__(c, d). How can I make a generic method called copy() in A() that when called in B(), will return a B() object and not an A() object
[05:21:34] <salparadise> randomA: maybe: def copy(self): return type(self)(self.op, self.left.copy(), self.right.copy())

[11:23:43] <FrankyCyborg> Hello! I just compiled python 2.7.15 and running the testsuite some tests fail, which are likely unexpected to fail. I would like to inspect any detailed log file(s) of the testsuite, to resolve these failures, but can't find any log file(s). Does the testsuite produce any log file(s) or does it require a special argument to produce one/them? (and by the way I would like to enable the tests, where the testsuite output states "test

[11:24:59] <siwica> I am using the logging module within my application.

This way a logging message ends up (differently formatted) both in stdout and in the syslog.
[11:25:01] <Yhg1s> FrankyCyborg: the one test taht exits with 'requires a lot of disk-space' is test_zipfile_large, which you'll have to edit to enable. Other tests can be enabled by running 'make testall'.

[13:05:43] <cdunklau> krux02: __call__ is a method you can write on a class to make _instances_ of that class callable
[13:05:45] <Wooble> krux02: __call__ is what is called when you try to use the instance as if it were a function.

[13:07:48] <meriipu> cdunklau: whether I should avoid defining (small) helper functions in nested scopes or blocks even if it might increase readability
[13:08:13] <krux02> so currently I have this "return self.reprEnum(self.val, self.nti)" and self.repr is the value with the __call__ member"

[15:01:46] <krux02> Well the worst thing an application can do is "thinking" the terminal can't handle unicode and it converts everything in "???", also called destroying data
[15:01:57] <Yhg1s> kbaegis: the way you use the subprocess module produces bytes, and print doesn't print bytes. You have to decode them first. You do that using io.TextIOWrapper (not the best solution, but nevermind that). Your terminal can't print the characters that produces, because print thinks your terminal uses ASCII. That's why you get the UnicodeEncodeError.

[15:03:13] <krux02> wait isn't the terminal resposible to decode the data into unicode glyphs?

How should i understand this? Does it mean that normal dicts in python now behave like OrderedDict?
[19:19:15] <amz3> but you would achieve the same with generator = range(100)

[19:45:15] <Owner> i guess i could live with that...suprised theres no shorthand
[19:45:18] <bjs> Owner: that’s fine, but when there’s a common style that is opposite to yours it’s good to reflect on both
[19:45:31] <bjs> Owner: shorthand?
[19:45:32] <Owner> bjs: i dont write code for other people though :)
[19:45:32] <vjeko_hrolfr> Because generally people don't do multiple imports on a single line like that.
[19:45:48] <bjs> Owner: future you is a very different person to current you
[19:45:49] <vjeko_hrolfr> So they wouldn't design a shorthand specifically to enable that.
[19:45:51] <unpythonic> The reason most people put them onto separate lines is that it's easier to see in the commit history what changed.
[19:45:52] <Owner> vjeko_hrolfr: well eventually im going ot have like 100 lines of imports
[19:46:04] <vjeko_hrolfr> That's also a code smell.

[19:46:28] <vjeko_hrolfr> You should probably refactor into smaller files if you have a huge number of imports.
[19:46:38] <Owner> but then i have a huge number of files
[19:46:54] <vjeko_hrolfr> Probably not a huge number, but possibly if your project is large, yes.
[19:47:15] <vjeko_hrolfr> One of the design principles of Python is that code is read more often than it is written.

[20:26:50] <sveinse> Under my windows environment I have three ways of calling py from command-line, cmd shell, bash for git and powershell. While the bash for git uses a terminal of its own, so it needs winpty to get continous output. I'm seeing that powershell also outputs all stdout in one "go". Is it expected that py should work from powershell?

[20:44:04] <pql> just use sha3/sha256
[20:44:04] <NoImNotNineVolt> for example, if you're using apache nifi, the only hash supported by the built-in HashProcessor is md5.

[20:44:30] <NoImNotNineVolt> so if you want to use other hashes, you've gotta build your own nifi processors to generate them.
[20:44:31] <SnoopJeDi> In part because of MD5 (and bad design otherwise), you can open anyone else's lock for the price of asking.

[20:47:18] <FrankyCyborg> ok, use case for you all: there is ancient hardware / software, which only does know about MD5, maybe even only MD2, for "integrity checks" (or any other inner workings) - and the client tells me "now, this thing works and will do so, until I die (and isn't connected to the network), but we need anothe interface or import/export stuff.."    I surely will not tell him "well, MD5 is broken, we need to reverse engineer it, to tell it how
