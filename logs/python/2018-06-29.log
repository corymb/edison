[08:31:04] <Hasimir> [Tritium], you do realise that significantly large portions of the full UTF-8 and UTF-16 code points can't even be allocated, right?  To the tune of several blocks of plane 0 and at least two or three entire planes at the upper end
[08:31:41] <Hasimir> I just keep forgetting which ones (they're allocated for private use)
[08:31:43] <[Tritium]> Hasimir: UTF-8 and UTF-16 are byte encodings of unicode - unicode is only concerned with ints
[08:32:18] <[Tritium]> and I did just say that 1/10th of unicode has been allocated - 1.1 million vs. 110k
[08:32:42] <energizer> can they add more if they run out of the 1.1M?

[08:46:31] <Hasimir> but I get why people assume so
[08:46:41] <cdunklau> Choscura: utf-8 can encode anything in unicode

[08:46:58] <Choscura> but there's an international standard default, iirc?

[08:50:32] <Choscura> well, thai's tonal, it has tone markers, there's an imported vocab from sanskrit so they literally have a character for "etc" so they have the sanskrit word, abbreviated in thai, with an 'etc' tacked on the end

I'm wondering: Does it assign "full yellow" to the value 255 and full blue to 0? Or does examine each `greyscale_image` instantiation, and assign "full yellow" to the highest value and "full blue" to the minimum. So if e.g. the highest
[14:55:26] <multifractal> pixel value in `greyscale_image` is only 200, it scales that to be the highest yellow?

[15:52:57] <SnoopJeDi> I'm all for the "just let me create the bag!" kernel of @attr.s or @dataclass, but unsure if that kernel justifies ripping up the neat foundation of the word 'class'

[20:01:29] <randomA> I have a question. I have Nodes in a tree. And I am writing a method called remove(self, child, replace=None) Ieally, the node I call it for, will remove the specified child. However, the child is not necessarily under the same name. So I don't now if child referes to self.left or self.right. Is there any way to figure out which one?

[23:05:47] <Ninpo> Owner: if you've simply "installed ntpd" then it only gradually corrects the time.  For a quicker update you just need to run ntpclient to initially sync, then start ntpd which will keep it synced

[23:54:21] <sequoia_> yesterday, a little bit of code showed in my console while it was running. like "def func() blah blah". I wonder if it was because my computer was running lots of things and was under strain? i don't know. maybe I imagined it.
[23:54:25] <shodan45> RandomNoob: are you 100% sure it's a dbase 2 file? or is the file extension just .db2?
