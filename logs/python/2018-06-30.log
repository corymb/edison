[06:26:38] <iamnotarocket> Hello
[06:26:59] <iamnotarocket> Is there anything along the lines of Lisp's SLIM that would give me a good "interactive" python env within vim?
[06:27:14] <iamnotarocket> ideally, I want something similar to Jupiter Notebook but with vim.
[06:28:06] <iamnotarocket> Or similar to Xcode Swift Playground
[06:28:14] <iamnotarocket> what I want to do? learn python.
[06:28:17] *** Quits: inerthia (~inerthia@unaffiliated/inerthia) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[06:28:22] <iamnotarocket> but I don't like typing in a prompt or constant reloading.
[06:28:31] <SnoopJeDi> iamnotarocket, do you specifically want to run IPython in vim, or do you just want vim bindings?

[06:29:21] <iamnotarocket> So vim bindings in IPython/Jupyter is not good enough :(
[06:29:22] <SnoopJeDi> but I wouldn't be surprised if someone has done some kind of magick to make ipython work in vim
[06:30:52] <iamnotarocket> Yeah
[06:30:59] <iamnotarocket> I think so too, but can't find anything
[06:31:02] <iamnotarocket> haven't found anything yet anyways
[06:31:38] <iamnotarocket> okay
[06:31:43] <iamnotarocket> so looks like there is a few for NeoVim

[09:17:03] <julius> ive got a dictionary with different information for one key, i would like to order this information according to the length of the list that associated with each key.   currently im creating the data as follows: getting the information from files on disk, saving them into a dict:   mydict=['somekey'],  mydict['somekey']['info1], mydict['somekey'][1,2,3,4,5], mydict['somekey']['moreinfo]            thats all the information i want, but ordered according to
[09:17:04] <julius> the length of the list, so i add all the small lists to a big one and then iterate over the map looking for the key with the list as value
[09:17:44] <julius> the list is ordered by sorted
[09:17:54] <julius> is there a better way?

[12:49:56] <DarkUranium> computer vision is about the computer *recognizing* things in the video (e.g. spatial tracking, feature detection, area mapping, ...)
[12:50:10] <nuxil> i dont need any of that
[12:50:15] <MrElendig> nuxil: used to, now it is a mix of lgpl and gpl (and a tiny bit non-free)

[12:52:28] <DarkUranium> You might like Qt then, it even has serial I/O.
[12:52:49] <DarkUranium> and it depends on what you mean by "shit license". Qt is LGPL. You can dynamically link with it, but not statically (well, you can, but then your own program has to be [L]GPL, and same version of GPL at that)

[13:29:24] <Aoik> Hi, I have a question about Python's grammar file. It has several rules that have branches starting with the same symbol. E.g. argument: ( test [comp_for] | test '=' test | '**' test | '*' test ) . It seems not being LL(1).
[13:29:38] <qsx> when an email.message.Message contains a non-ascii/unicode header, mailbox.Maildir().add() should escape those headers, but instead i get a confusing traceback

[18:21:21] <ali1234> _habnabit: it isn't a .py file
[18:21:29] <_habnabit> ali1234, a python source file
[18:21:34] <nedbat> ali1234: you'll need to help us find the spot you are concerned about
[18:21:44] <ali1234> it's a Dofile. it just happens to use python syntax

[18:25:55] <ali1234> it is true
[18:26:03] <_habnabit> ali1234, the thing is, you're allowing people to use all of python, not a 'simple' subset

[18:27:09] <ali1234> nedbat: in that scope, the module already has those attributes
[18:27:13] <_habnabit> ali1234, it seems like you're saying: if you need tools to debug your Dofile, then it's too complex, and you're doing it wrong. i would very much call that hostile

[18:39:30] <ali1234> so if i write "self.__default_commands__ = self.__default_commands__" then this makes the thing visible inside the module
[18:39:45] <_habnabit> just wait until you try using the properties ;)
[18:39:51] <ali1234> as expected, because as you said it makes an instance attribute out of it
[18:39:59] <ali1234> but yeah.. how can i do that with properties?
[18:40:04] <_habnabit> again, you can't
[18:40:15] <ali1234> that's what you said last time and then i did

[18:40:49] <_habnabit> modules, again, circumvent all class-defined attribute lookup
[18:41:01] <pi--> bjs: my question was more "why should `import x` care if the file containing the import is being run as a standalone or as part of a package, and is there any way of allowing both usages, and is there some underlying fault with the package management design?"

[18:41:44] <ali1234> nedbat: what's the alternative?
[18:41:57] <nedbat> ali1234: make it an instance of any class you want.

[21:11:19] <runciter> altendky, i wouldn't start with caching, otherwise yes
[21:12:21] <runciter> altendky, this whole thing is slippery because it deals entirely with data that's available only at an awkward time: immediately after the class is allocated (i.e. __new__)
[21:12:24] <altendky> runciter: alrighty.  i think we'll just differ here for now on the approach to generic, but i will keep the suggestion in mind.  assign_identifier_path or IdentifierPath seem the tidiest to me.  but i'll probably leave it for now.
[21:12:56] <runciter> altendky, it feels like a good idea to push the computation as close to that time as possible, which would require a metaclass (real bad), a class decorator (ok), or a module-level function call (what you have)

[21:51:34] <enfinitee> @_habnabit my goal is to have a configuration file created the first time the script is run (the script will check if it's been run by checking a value to see if it is "True," meaning it has been run and already configured the conf file, or "False" if it needs to create it). If it needs to create the conf file, I want to put the OS in the JSON file
[21:51:34] <enfinitee> , but instead of just updating the key, it's deleting everything and only putting the key value in. Does that make sense?

[23:36:10] <nedbat__> ali1234: what we find here is that often people state criteria in objective terms, but actually it is very subjective.
[23:36:21] <_habnabit> ali1234, these imports are equally boilerplate

[23:36:53] <ali1234> okay, except a and b
[23:37:08] <ali1234> a and c
[23:37:42] <ali1234> i could go a step further and automatically import all submodules into the module namespace

[23:37:48] <ali1234> then i wouldn't even need that import
[23:38:12] <ali1234> it would be tricky to do though, because the module path isn't set up when __init__ is called
[23:38:19] <altendky> Mm, namespace merging. Everything is global
[23:38:21] <ali1234> so, yeah, this is not optimal

[23:52:17] <meth> what?
[23:52:23] <_habnabit> TheComet, from the C API? have you looked at cffi already?
[23:52:30] *** feodoran_ is now known as feodoran
[23:52:56] <offby1> Gimme methamphetamine, and don't argue
[23:53:08] <TheComet> The official docs say you need to define your function as a PyCFunction, which means PyObject* whataver(PyObject* self, PyObject* args) https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyMethodDef
[23:53:18] <TheComet> But then you go over to the tutorial page https://docs.python.org/3.4/extending/newtypes.html
[23:53:24] <offby1> meth: imagine how often _I_ get highlighted (hint: less than you'd think)
[23:53:32] <TheComet> and you find static PyObject *Noddy_name(Noddy* self) <--- no second argument here
[23:53:56] <TheComet> _habnabit, I haven't looked at cffi, will that be helpful?
[23:54:11] <TheComet> What I'm worrying about here is that if I don't declare it with the second argument it could corrupt the stack frame or something
[23:54:20] <_habnabit> TheComet, yes. the C API is pretty atrocious. cffi is the modern replacement

[23:56:16] <_habnabit> TheComet, yes, the C API is pretty shoddy

[23:58:46] <TheComet> I just checked the source code, Objects/call.c:482 calls functions marked with METH_NOARGS using result = (*meth) (self, NULL);
[23:59:03] <TheComet> People who provide functions with just one argument as many tutorials recommend you do will cause stack corruption
